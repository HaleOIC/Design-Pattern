# Design Pattern

There are a lot of codes written by myself, but the key thinking is not understood, sometime, we may make the codes longer and harder to understand and mountain with the requirement taking place in the designing process. the `design pattern` is to simplify the process and make it easy to write the better codes for mountain and changing.

There are twenty three kinds of design patterns:

- `Abstract Factory`
- `Adapter`
- `Bridge`
- `Builder`
- `Chain of Responsibility`
- `Command`
- `Composite`
- `Decorator`
- `Facade`
- `Factory Method`
- `Flyweight`
- `interpreter`
- `iterator`
- `mediator`
- `memento`
- `observer`
- `prototype`
- `proxy`
- `singleton`
- `state`
- `strategy`
- `template method`
- `visitor`

Each part of the design pattern has a corresponding code example, and the useful reference is [:sailboat:refer](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Yr4y157Ci/)
